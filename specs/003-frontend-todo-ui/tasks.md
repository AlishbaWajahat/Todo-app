# Tasks: Frontend UI & Profile Integration

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-frontend-todo-ui/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/api-integration.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Not included - tests are optional and not requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Frontend**: `frontend/` directory at repository root
- **App Router**: `frontend/app/` for Next.js pages and layouts
- **Components**: `frontend/components/` for React components
- **Library**: `frontend/lib/` for utilities, API clients, types

---

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Authentication & Session Management (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Enable users to sign up, sign in, and maintain authenticated sessions with JWT tokens stored securely in httpOnly cookies

**Independent Test**:
1. Navigate to /signup, create account → redirected to /dashboard
2. Sign out → redirected to /signin
3. Sign in with credentials → redirected to /dashboard
4. Refresh page → still authenticated (session persists)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently - full task CRUD with filtering/sorting

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - User Profile Management (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Enable authenticated users to view and update their profile information including name and avatar picture

**Independent Test**:
1. Sign in and click "Profile" in navigation
2. View current profile information (name, email, avatar)
3. Update name → click Save → name updated in header
4. Upload new avatar image → preview shown → click Save → avatar updated in header
5. Refresh page → changes persist

- [ ] T075 [US3] Test profile management flow per quickstart.md section "Profile Management Flow"

**Checkpoint**: All core user stories (1, 2, 3) should now be independently functional - auth, tasks, and profile complete

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Responsive Design & Accessibility (Priority: P4)

**Goal**: Ensure the application is fully responsive across devices and meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards

**Independent Test**:
1. Open app on mobile device (or DevTools mobile view) → layout adapts properly
2. Test all features on mobile → fully functional
3. Open app on tablet → layout adapts to tablet size
4. Test keyboard navigation → all interactive elements accessible via Tab
5. Test with screen reader → all content properly announced
6. Test color contrast → meets WCAG AA standards
7. Test on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) → consistent behavior

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (Auth) should complete first as it's required for testing other stories
  - User Stories 2 and 3 can proceed in parallel after US1 (if staffed)
  - User Story 4 (Responsive) should come after core features are implemented
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1) - Authentication**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2) - Task Management**: Depends on US1 completion (requires authentication to test)
- **User Story 3 (P3) - Profile Management**: Depends on US1 completion (requires authentication to test) - Can run parallel with US2
- **User Story 4 (P4) - Responsive Design**: Depends on US1, US2, US3 completion (applies responsive/accessibility to all features)

### Within Each User Story

- Type definitions before API clients
- API clients before components that use them
- Base components before page components
- Pages before validation and error handling
- Core implementation before testing
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: T003, T004, T005, T007, T008, T009 can run in parallel
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T012-T016, T020-T024 can run in parallel
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: T027-T028, T031-T034 can run in parallel
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: T047-T052 can run in parallel
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: T064-T067 can run in parallel
- **Phase 6 (US4)**: T076-T089 can run in parallel (most responsive/accessibility tasks)
- **Phase 7 (Polish)**: T093-T097, T100-T101 can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Authentication)

```bash
# Launch all parallel tasks for User Story 1 together:

Task T033: "Create SignInForm component in frontend/components/auth/SignInForm.tsx"
Task T034: "Create SignUpForm component in frontend/components/auth/SignUpForm.tsx"
```

---

Task T052: "Create DeleteConfirmModal component in frontend/components/tasks/DeleteConfirmModal.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Authentication)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently per quickstart.md
5. Deploy/demo if ready - users can sign up and sign in

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (Auth) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP - authentication works!)
3. Add User Story 2 (Tasks) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (users can manage tasks!)
4. Add User Story 3 (Profile) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (users can customize profile!)
5. Add User Story 4 (Responsive) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (works on all devices!)
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Authentication) - MUST complete first
3. Once US1 is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (Task Management)
   - Developer B: User Story 3 (Profile Management)
4. Once US2 and US3 are done:
   - Developer A or B: User Story 4 (Responsive Design)
5. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within phase
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Follow quickstart.md testing flows to verify each story
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- All file paths are relative to repository root
- Tests are not included as they were not requested in the specification
